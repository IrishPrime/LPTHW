Exercises for [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/).

This repository contains the exercises suggested by Zed A. Shaw's *Learn Python
the Hard Way (3rd Edition)*, but written in Python 3. I'm not attempting to
rewrite his very excellent book or reproduce his work; I'm just trying to
complete the course with some friends who are new to programming and be an
additional resource for them.
