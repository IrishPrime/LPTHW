# LPTHW

This repository contains the exercises suggested by Zed A. Shaw's *[Learn
Python the Hard Way (3rd Edition)](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)*,
but written in Python 3. I'm not attempting to rewrite his very excellent book
or reproduce his work; I'm just trying to complete the course with some friends
who are new to programming and be an additional resource for them.
